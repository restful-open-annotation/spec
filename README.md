# RESTful Open Annotation service specification

This respository created as a placeholder for materials and discussion related to the specification of RESTful Open Annotation services. Actual content TODO.

## Aims / goals / design

* Adhere to Linked Data principles: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html
  * Use dereferenceable HTTP URIs as names for things, return useful information
* Use the Open Annotation (OA) data model http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/
  * Require support for the OA JSON-LD serialization http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/publishing.html
  * Allow other RDF serializations
* Stick to existing standards and best practices
* Simple, minimal API
