# RESTful Open Annotation

This is an incomplete draft of RESTful Open Annotation API
documentation. Current contents include:

* [Quickstart](quickstart.html)
* [Data model](data-model.html)
* [JSON-LD](json-ld.html)
* [OA context](context.html)
* [API details](api-detail.html)
* [Tools](tools.html)

This documentation is hosted on GitHub. You can start editing by
cloning the repository and switching to the `gh-pages` branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:restful-open-annotation/spec.git
    $ git checkout gh-pages

Your pushed changes will then show up on this page.

This page is written in [markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
and generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but for editing you don't
need to worry about that -- you can just treat the content as text.
