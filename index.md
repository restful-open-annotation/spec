# RESTful Open Annotation

This is the RESTful Open Annotation specification.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><span style="font-weight:bold">Please
note</span>: this is a pseudo-anonymous version of the specification
created for review purposes. The original, non-anonymous specification
is developed openly, and is trivial to find e.g. with any search engine.
We request reviewers to avoid related non-anonymous material.</div>
