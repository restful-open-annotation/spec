# RESTful Open Annotation

This is a placeholder for RESTful Open Annotation documentation.

This documentation is hosted on GitHub. You can start editing by
cloning the repository and switching to the `gh-pages` branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:restful-open-annotation/spec.git
    $ git checkout gh-pages

Your pushed changes will then show up on this page.

This page is written in [markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
and generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but for editing you don't
need to worry about that -- you can just treat the content as text.

* Install the prototype [eve-restoa](https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/eve-restoa) store
* Download the [restoa-tools](https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/restoa-tools)
* Use the `import.py` script in the latter to upload example annotations (included) to the store

Documentation TODO.
