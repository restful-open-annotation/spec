# RESTful Open Annotation

This is a placeholder for RESTful Open Annotation documentation.

This documentation is hosted on GitHub. You can start editing by
cloning the repository and switching to the `gh-pages` branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:restful-open-annotation/spec.git
    $ git checkout gh-pages

Your pushed changes will then show up on this page.

This page is written in [markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
and generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but for editing you don't
need to worry about that -- you can just treat the content as text.
