# JSON-LD

JSON-LD is a simple JSON-based Linked Data format.

It is also the recommeded [Open Annotation
serialization](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/publishing.html)
format, and the default format used to represent annotations in the
RESTful Open Annotation API.

The benefits of JSON-LD include

* It is [JSON](http://json.org): easy to read and write, and
  increasingly the *de facto* standard language of web APIs.
* It is [RDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework): 
  the language of [Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data), allowing the use of extensive existing resources.
* It adds [links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) to JSON, making it possible to write better [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) JSON APIs.
* It has [great documentation](http://json-ld.org/learn.html), including
  an exceptionally readable [W3C specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/).
* It has [good library support](http://json-ld.org/#developers) and 
  [learning tools](http://json-ld.org/playground/index.html).

Given the quality and quantity of existing material on JSON-LD, we
won't try to present it here but will instead simply refer interested
readers to [json-ld.org](http://json-ld.org). Some basics are
discussed also in the presentation of the [OA context](context.html).
