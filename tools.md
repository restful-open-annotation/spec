* [restoa-explorer](https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/restoa-explorer): Server for exploring RESTful OA stores

This works now:

* Install the prototype [eve-restoa](https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/eve-restoa) store
* Download the [restoa-tools](https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/restoa-tools)
* Use the `import.py` script in the latter to upload example annotations (included) to the store
  * Alternatively, you can for example use [knowtator2oa](https://github.com/spyysalo/knowtator2oa) to convert the [CRAFT](http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/CRAFT/) corpus data
* Install [restoa-explorer](https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/restoa-explorer) to visualize annotations
